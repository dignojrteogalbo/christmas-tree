##Christmas Tree Decorator
I made a little christmas tree decorator with the [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) library hosted by Google's [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) hosting.

This is a small project to experiment and practice with Git, Javascript libraries, and Firebase.

##Current Features
* Place customizable (size, color, shape) ornaments onto environment.
* Export (.glb) and import (.glb/.gltf) files.

##Upcoming Features
* Gallery where users can upload and download published Christmas trees with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/). 
* Storing Christmas trees serverside with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

ok thanks bye.
